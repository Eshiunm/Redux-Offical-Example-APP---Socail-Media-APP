# Redux Essentials Tutorial Example

This project contains the setup and code from the "Redux Essentials" tutorial example app in the Redux docs ( https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-3-data-flow ).

The `master` branch has a single commit that already has the initial project configuration in place. You can use this as the starting point to follow along with the instructions from the tutorial.

The `tutorial-steps-ts` branch has the actual code commits from the tutorial. You can look at these to see how the official tutorial actually implements each piece of functionality along the way.

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and is based on the [official Redux Toolkit + Vite template](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-templates/tree/master/packages/vite-template-redux).
